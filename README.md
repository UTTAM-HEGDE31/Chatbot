# Chatbot
This Python chatbot, built with NLTK, uses regex patterns to simulate conversations. It responds to greetings, introductions, and simple queries about help, weather, and sports. With basic reflections for natural replies, it chats interactively until the user types "quit," making it a simple yet engaging AI bot.
